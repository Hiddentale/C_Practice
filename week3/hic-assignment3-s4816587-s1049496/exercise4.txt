The programm is killed by the system, I think this might happen because it allocates too much heap memory towards itself?
Might also be that malloc doesn't free the memory properly because the previous pointer value to the allocated memory is overwritten/corrupted? It seems this is not the case
because the scope makes sure the pointers are always the same.
I thought about this some more and see that there is a significant problem, m and mt are freed, but every m[i] and mt[i] is never freed, which causes a memory leak.

I would fix this by actually freeing all the memory that was allocated before we start on a new iteration of the while loop.
