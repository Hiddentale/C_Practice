The command I have used is: 
tr -d '\n' < genome.txt | grep -o "GATTACA" | wc -l

First we trim all the newline characters of our text file, then we let grep search for all occurences 
of the specified string and let wordcount with there parameter for linecount count the number of actual occurences.

The number of occurences that it gave was:
4
